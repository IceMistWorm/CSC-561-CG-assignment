Directly open the index.html file, the result of part 2 (Blinn-Phong lighting) will directly open in a chrome browser.

The brief introduction of my implementation will be stated below:

The functions:

drawPixelsInputSpheresUsingRayCasting(context)
drawPixelsInputSpheresUsingRayCastingAndLight(context)

are implemented in javascript drawstuff.js. In my homework, the skeleton given by the homework is used directly and 
these two new functions are added to meet the criteria of the homework. 
For the first function, drawPixelsInputSpheresUsingRayCasting(context) is my solution for part one (raycasting). It is commented now 
since we need only show our work in part 2. The function, drawPixelsInputSpheresUsingRayCastingAndLight(context), directly uses 
the method in part one function, and adding some lighting equation inside.
