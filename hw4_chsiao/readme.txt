Discription: 

	This is a project of using three.js to implement the frogger game. Although only using the simple model(rectangle) 
  and basic texture, the game functionality is well implemented. There are two stage in this game. To pass first stage,
  you only need successfully send two frogs. A second stage is endless, with faster cars and logs and a wierd moving car.
  Score is also kept during the game.

Control:

 a: move frog left
 d: move frog right
 w: move frog front
 s: move frog back
 f: first person frogger
