Please directly open the index.html file, the result will be shown in a chrome browser.

In the index.html file, I implememted all 5 parts. Using the assigned key can see the translation and rotation.

But just in case it might be broken when given different input files, 

(since implementating in part 5, I use some brute force methods to do it) maybe some contents will be missing(wish it won't happen!). 

Therefore,a backup.html file is given for only the first 4 part, it is implemented in more a flexible way, but it does not include part 5.
